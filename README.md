This will be the README for the recipes website project for TOP. I believe it will showcase the skills I have learned thus far regarding linking pages together, using different html tags and creating a very basic plain website

This will be for after I'm done: This was fairly simple I guess, I know I'm new to this world so I'm sure it's going to get a whole lot more complicated.
